    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://medithanks.com/#/">Medi+thanks</a>, winner of 2020 GA Holiday Hackathon. I collaborated with a team of 6, including 2 UX Designers and 3 other Software Engineers, to build an app allowing people to send thank-you notes to frontline workers during the COVID pandemic. Users can log in, view their thank-you notes, edit and delete their notes, and search for notes, and add emojis with an emoji keyboard. This app and our team was featured in Rhode Island Inno.</li>
      <li><a href="https://ga-motivate.herokuapp.com/login">GA Motivate</a>, winner of the 2020 GA Immersive Alumni 3-day hackathon. I worked with a team of 8, including 2 UX Designers, to build an app designed to motivate and encourage GA graduates of various immersive programs who are looking for jobs. Users can log in and see their posts as well as others' posts, reply to posts, and create & edit their profiles.</li>
